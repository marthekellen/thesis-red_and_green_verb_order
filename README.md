# thesis-red_and_green_verb_order

These are the scripts used for my thesis regarding the red and green verb order in Dutch two-verb clusters. This study
investigates this form of variation by inspecting the embeddings of the BERTje model, and also examines whether transformer models can accurately predict the verb order.
